    <p>
      Sports injuries are not limited to professional athletes. At OrthoCure, we commonly treat injuries related to gym workouts, badminton, cricket, football, running, walking, and weekend recreational sports.
    </p>

    <p>
      These injuries may involve muscles, ligaments, tendons, or joints and often occur due to sudden overload, improper technique, or inadequate recovery.
    </p>

    <h2>Common sports injuries we treat</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ankle sprains and ligament injuries</li>
      <li>Knee injuries including meniscus and ligament tears</li>
      <li>Muscle strains of the thigh, calf, and shoulder</li>
      <li>Shoulder pain and instability related to sports or gym activity</li>
      <li>Tennis elbow and overuse injuries</li>
      <li>Sports related fractures</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our approach to sports injury care</h2>
    <p>
      Not every sports injury needs surgery or prolonged rest. Our approach focuses on accurate diagnosis, controlling pain and swelling, early safe movement, and structured rehabilitation.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Detailed clinical examination</li>
      <li>Digital X ray when required</li>
      <li>Short term pain control</li>
      <li>Physiotherapy guided recovery</li>
      <li>Gradual and safe return to activity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When surgery may be required</h2>
    <p>
      Most sports injuries improve with conservative treatment. However, evidence based orthopaedic practice shows that certain injuries benefit from surgical management, particularly in physically active individuals who wish to return to sports.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Complete ACL tear with knee instability</strong> in patients with repeated giving way episodes</li>
      <li><strong>Recurrent shoulder dislocation or instability</strong> in individuals involved in contact or overhead sports</li>
      <li><strong>Displaced ligament or tendon injuries</strong> that fail to improve with adequate conservative care</li>
      <li><strong>Selected meniscus tears</strong> causing locking or persistent mechanical symptoms</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Decisions regarding surgery are never based on scans alone. They are made after proper clinical examination, discussion of activity goals, and clear explanation of expected recovery.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      Surgery is advised only when it clearly improves long term joint stability, function, and ability to return to sports. It is not recommended routinely for every sports injury.
    </div>

    <h2>Physiotherapy and rehabilitation</h2>
    <p>
      Rehabilitation is a critical part of recovery from sports injuries, whether treated conservatively or surgically. At OrthoCure, physiotherapy is coordinated directly with the treating orthopaedic surgeon to ensure safe and complete recovery.
    </p>

    <p class="small">
      Sports injury recovery often overlaps with our
      <a href="/services/physiotherapy-thirumullaivoyal.html">Physiotherapy services</a>
      and
      <a href="/services/knee-arthritis.html">Knee arthritis care</a>
      when injuries occur on a background of joint wear.
    </p>

    <h2>When to seek immediate medical care</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Severe pain or swelling after injury</li>
      <li>Inability to bear weight or use the limb</li>
      <li>Visible deformity</li>
      <li>Repeated giving way of a joint</li>
    </ul>
