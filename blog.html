      <h2>Do I Have Early Arthritis? ‚Äî 7 Silent Signs You Shouldn‚Äôt Ignore</h2>
      <p class="post-date">Published on June 9, 2025 by Dr. Sumesh Subramanian</p>

      <p><strong>‚ÄúDoctor, my knees hurt‚Ä¶ but only in the mornings. Is that normal?‚Äù</strong></p>
      <p>This is one of the most common questions I hear at OrthoCure Bone & Joint Speciality Clinic. Arthritis, especially in its early stages, can disguise itself as minor stiffness or occasional discomfort. But those subtle signs may be your body‚Äôs early warning system, and recognizing them can change the course of your joint health.</p>

      <h3>Understanding Early Arthritis</h3>
      <p>Arthritis is not just one condition‚Äîit‚Äôs a broad term that covers over 100 different joint disorders. The most common forms include osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. While late-stage arthritis causes obvious pain and joint deformities, early arthritis can be deceptively quiet.</p>

      <h3>7 Early Signs You Shouldn't Ignore</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Morning Stiffness:</strong> Stiffness that lasts longer than 30 minutes after waking up may suggest inflammation, not aging.</li>
        <li><strong>Joint Warmth & Swelling:</strong> Even without trauma, inflamed joints may feel hot and appear swollen.</li>
        <li><strong>Clicking or Grinding:</strong> If your knees sound like bubble wrap or your fingers click when bending, cartilage breakdown may have begun.</li>
        <li><strong>Fatigue Out of Proportion:</strong> Feeling unusually tired, even with enough rest, can signal underlying autoimmune arthritis.</li>
        <li><strong>Pain at Rest:</strong> Unlike muscular pain that improves with rest, arthritis pain often worsens when you're inactive.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Range of Motion:</strong> Struggling to open jars, kneel, or raise your arms might be more than just stiffness‚Äîit could be joint degeneration.</li>
        <li><strong>Family History:</strong> A genetic predisposition to arthritis significantly increases your risk‚Äîeven if symptoms seem minor.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What Arthritis Isn‚Äôt</h3>
      <p>Contrary to popular belief, arthritis isn't only for the elderly. In fact, many of my patients at OrthoCure are in their 30s and 40s. It‚Äôs also not always caused by wear-and-tear‚Äîmany inflammatory forms have nothing to do with activity level or injury.</p>

      <h3>Why Early Diagnosis Matters</h3>
      <p>Early arthritis is often reversible or manageable without surgery. Treatments like physiotherapy, orthobiologic injections, and weight-bearing modifications can significantly improve joint health when started in time. Delaying treatment, on the other hand, leads to cartilage loss and long-term disability.</p>

      <h3>What Should You Do?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Track your symptoms in a notebook or phone app</li>
        <li>Don‚Äôt ignore pain that ‚Äúcomes and goes‚Äù regularly</li>
        <li>Schedule a professional orthopaedic assessment</li>
      </ul>
