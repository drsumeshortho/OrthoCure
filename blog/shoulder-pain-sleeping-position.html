    <h1>Best Sleeping Position for Shoulder Pain</h1>
    <p><em>Updated October 2025</em></p>

    <p>Many Chennai residents who sleep on their side wake up with shoulder stiffness or dull pain. Recent global studies confirm what local orthopaedic experience has long observed—your <strong>sleeping position and pillow height</strong> directly affect shoulder joint pressure and recovery.</p>

    <h2>What Research Shows</h2>
    <p>Studies from the <em>Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2024)</em> and <em>Applied Ergonomics (2021)</em> show that side-lying increases subacromial pressure and compresses the rotator cuff, while sleeping on your back (supine position) keeps the shoulder neutral and stress-free. Pillow height matters too—too high bends the neck sideways, too low increases shoulder load. The optimal pillow height is around <strong>8–12 cm</strong> for most adults, supporting both the neck and shoulder curve.</p>

    <h2>Local Factors in Chennai</h2>
    <p>In humid climates like Chennai, people often use thin pillows or sleep on coir mattresses, which can worsen shoulder and neck strain. Airflow from ceiling fans or AC units directly onto the shoulder may also cause overnight muscle cooling and stiffness. The good news—supine sleeping with light shoulder support works well even in warm weather.</p>

    <h2>Doctor’s Recommendation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Best position:</strong> Lie on your back with a small rolled towel or thin pillow under the affected shoulder and elbow.</li>
      <li><strong>If you must side-sleep:</strong> Choose the non-painful side, use a medium-height pillow, and keep your top arm supported on a cushion.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Sleeping on the painful side, very low or high pillows, or tucking the arm under your body.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This posture preserves the subacromial space and reduces rotator cuff compression. Over time, it helps the shoulder heal more efficiently and keeps morning stiffness away.</p>
