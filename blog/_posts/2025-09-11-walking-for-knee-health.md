🚶‍♂️ **Walking and Knee Arthritis — Harmful or Helpful?**

A common belief is that walking worsens knee arthritis.  
👉 Truth: **Regular, moderate walking actually protects your joints.**  

- Helps nourish cartilage by circulating synovial fluid  
- Strengthens supporting muscles  
- Improves flexibility & balance  

⚠️ Caveat: If pain is severe, start slow, avoid uneven surfaces, and consult your orthopaedic doctor.  

**Bottom Line:** Walking isn’t the enemy — it’s part of the solution.
