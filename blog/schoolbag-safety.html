Introduction
Every morning, children across Chennai hoist backpacks that are often heavier than they should be. Studies show that many schoolchildren carry bags that exceed 15 % of their body weight, causing back pain, posture issues and even spinal deformities. To protect growing spines, the Indian Ministry of Education’s 2020 School Bag Policy caps school bag weight at no more than 10 % of a student’s body weight for Classes 1–10. This post explains why that recommendation matters, how heavy bags harm musculoskeletal health and what parents can do today.

Why Heavy Backpacks Hurt

Spinal stress: A heavy backpack compresses soft, developing vertebrae and can cause deformities like scoliosis or kyphosis.

Muscle and joint strain: Prolonged use of heavy backpacks leads to stiffness and chronic pain in the neck, shoulders and lower back.

Poor posture: Carrying a bag on one shoulder or letting it hang low forces children to lean forward or tilt to one side.

Long‑term consequences: Research from a 2025 cross‑sectional study found that more than half of students who carried bags exceeding 15 % of their body weight reported back pain.  Carrying a bag by one shoulder or walking to school with a heavy bag was significantly associated with back pain.


National & International Guidelines

The School Bag Policy 2020 advises that:

The weight of a school bag should not exceed 10 % of the child’s body weight.

Bags must have proper compartments and two padded, adjustable straps that sit squarely on both shoulders.

Schools should provide lockers, digital weighing machines and ensure potable water to reduce the need for heavy water bottles.


Other health experts recommend a slightly wider range of 10–15 % of body weight; exceeding that is linked to musculoskeletal pain. International evidence and WHO recommendations similarly limit bag weight and emphasise ergonomic design.

Choosing the Right Bag

1. Weight: Keep the full bag weight under 10–15 % of your child’s body weight. Weigh the bag regularly at home or with the school’s digital scale.


2. Ergonomics: Choose backpacks with wide, padded straps, a padded back panel and compartments to distribute weight evenly.


3. Adjustability: Ensure straps are adjustable so the bag sits high on the back; the bottom should align at waist level.


4. No wheeled carriers: The Ministry’s policy warns against wheeled carriers as they can injure children on stairs.


5. Avoid overpacking: Pack only essential items and encourage schools to provide digital resources or lockers to reduce load.



How to Wear a Backpack Correctly

Use both shoulder straps to distribute weight symmetrically.

Pack heavy items close to the child’s back to align the load with the body’s centre of gravity.

Keep straps snug to prevent the bag from hanging low and pulling the child backwards.

For very heavy items (e.g. sports gear or instruments), consider separate carry options or wheelie bags.


Practical Tips for Parents & Schools

Monitor daily weight: Check the bag at least weekly; if it exceeds the recommended limit, talk to teachers about reducing required materials.

Remove non‑essential items: Encourage children to take out toys, multiple pencil boxes or extra books daily.

Advocate for lockers: Work with your school to provide storage spaces so students don’t have to lug all their textbooks.

Encourage physical activity: Strengthening the core, back and shoulder muscles helps children carry weight safely.

Educate caregivers: Schools and parents should teach children how to pack and wear their backpacks correctly.
