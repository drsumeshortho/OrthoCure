        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 1.02em;">
          At OrthoCure Bone and Joint Speciality Clinic in Thirumullaivoyal, we often see people who have been walking on a stress fracture for many days. The pain came on slowly, X rays were normal early, and they thought it was only a simple strain. By the time they arrive, the crack in the bone has already grown.
        </p>

    <section style="margin-bottom: 32px;">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.75em; color: #0f172a; margin-bottom: 14px;">What Is a Stress Fracture?</h2>
      <p>
        A stress fracture is a small crack in the bone caused by repeated stress over time rather than a single fall or accident. Bone is living tissue. It repairs itself every day. When the load on the bone increases faster than its capacity to repair, tiny cracks appear. If this continues, the crack becomes deeper and more painful.
      </p>
      <p>Stress fractures affect weight bearing bones most often, such as:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Metatarsals in the foot</li>
        <li>Tibia in the leg</li>
        <li>Heel bone</li>
        <li>Hip region in active adults and the elderly</li>
        <li>Navicular bone and other midfoot structures</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For Chennai residents, long commutes on hard surfaces, standing jobs, thin footwear and common vitamin D deficiency together create the perfect environment for these injuries.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size: 1.75em; color: #0f172a; margin-bottom: 14px;">How Stress Fractures Actually Start</h2>

      <p style="font-weight: 500; color: #111827; margin-bottom: 8px;">
        Tiny cracks form long before the real pain begins.
      </p>

      <h3 style="font-size: 1.15em; margin-top: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px;">1. Sudden jump in activity</h3>
      <p>
        A new fitness routine, extra morning walks, unplanned long distance travel or marathon practice can overload bones that are not yet conditioned. The muscles tire, the bone takes more load, and microdamage starts.
      </p>

      <h3 style="font-size: 1.15em; margin-top: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px;">2. Weak bones or low vitamin D</h3>
      <p>
        Many people in Chennai have low vitamin D and reduced bone strength despite living in a sunny climate. Softer bone bends a little with each step, which increases stress and encourages microcracks.
      </p>

      <h3 style="font-size: 1.15em; margin-top: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px;">3. Repetitive impact every day</h3>
      <p>
        Teachers, nurses, factory workers, sales staff, delivery workers and security personnel stand or walk for many hours on hard flooring. Each step adds a little more stress to the same area of bone.
      </p>

      <h3 style="font-size: 1.15em; margin-top: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px;">4. Poor cushioning and footwear</h3>
      <p>
        Thin chappals, worn out soles and hard concrete do not absorb shock. Over time, the impact transfers directly into the bone of the foot and leg.
      </p>

      <h3 style="font-size: 1.15em; margin-top: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px;">5. Ignoring early warning signs</h3>
      <p>
        Many people push through mild pain. They adjust their gait, change footwear or take over the counter pain tablets and continue walking. During this period the crack silently extends.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom: 32px;">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.75em; color: #0f172a; margin-bottom: 14px;">Typical Symptoms Patients Notice</h2>
      <p>
        Stress fracture pain has a characteristic pattern. Watch for these signs:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Pain that worsens with walking or standing and settles with rest</li>
        <li>Pain focused at a small, specific spot on the bone rather than a wide area</li>
        <li>Local tenderness when you press that point</li>
        <li>Mild swelling or warmth over the painful region</li>
        <li>Sharp pain when you hop on the same leg</li>
        <li>Pain that starts earlier in the day as days go by</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When pain that used to come only at the end of the day appears within a few steps in the morning, it often means the crack has progressed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom: 32px;">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.75em; color: #0f172a; margin-bottom: 14px;">Who Is At Higher Risk?</h2>
      <p>
        In our clinic at Thirumullaivoyal, stress fractures are especially common in these groups:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Women with vitamin D or calcium deficiency</li>
        <li>Adults above forty with low bone density</li>
        <li>People who suddenly increase walking, jogging or gym activity</li>
        <li>Standing job professionals such as teachers, nurses and retail staff</li>
        <li>People with previous fractures or known osteoporosis</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you belong to one of these groups and you have localised pain that worsens on weight bearing, it is safer to rule out a stress fracture early.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom: 32px;">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.75em; color: #0f172a; margin-bottom: 14px;">How We Confirm The Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        In the first few days, standard X rays often look normal even when a stress fracture is present. This can be misleading and is one reason people are reassured too early.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we suspect a stress fracture, assessment may include:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li><strong>Clinical examination</strong> to localise the painful point and assess bone and soft tissue</li>
        <li><strong>X rays</strong> to look for cracks, callus formation or other causes of pain</li>
        <li><strong>MRI</strong> when early confirmation is needed, especially in the hip or foot</li>
        <li><strong>Vitamin D and calcium tests</strong> if bone quality is a concern</li>
        <li><strong>Bone density scan</strong> in adults with repeated fractures or high risk</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal is simple: confirm the diagnosis early so you can protect the bone before the crack deepens.

      <h2 style="font-size: 1.75em; color: #0f172a; margin-bottom: 14px;">Treatment: How Stress Fractures Heal</h2>
      <p>
        The good news is that most stress fractures heal very well when treated early and protected properly. Surgery is rarely needed unless the crack is in a high risk location or has progressed to a complete break.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treatment usually focuses on three areas:
      </p>
      <ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>
          <strong>Reducing load on the bone</strong><br>
          Temporary rest from high impact activity, use of supportive footwear or braces and, in some cases, walking aids to offload the painful region.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top: 10px;">
          <strong>Improving bone health</strong><br>
          Vitamin D and calcium correction when required, assessment for osteoporosis in older adults and planning long term bone protection.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top: 10px;">
          <strong>Guided return to activity</strong><br>
          Gradual strengthening and flexibility work so that muscles share the load, followed by a step wise return to walking, jogging or sport.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Healing time varies from six to twelve weeks depending on the bone involved and how early treatment is started.

      <h2 style="font-size: 1.75em; color: #0f172a; margin-bottom: 14px;">Prevention: Daily Habits That Protect Your Bones</h2>
      <p>
        Stress fractures are often preventable. Stronger bone and smarter loading reduce your risk significantly.
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li><strong>Build strength</strong> in the legs and hips with simple exercises two or three times a week.</li>
        <li><strong>Work on balance</strong> so that missteps and abnormal loading are less likely.</li>
        <li><strong>Replace worn out footwear</strong> and avoid very thin soles on hard floors.</li>
        <li><strong>Increase activity gradually</strong> rather than suddenly jumping to long distances.</li>
        <li><strong>Check vitamin D and bone density</strong> if you are over fifty or have had previous fractures.</li>
        <li><strong>Listen to pain signals</strong> that repeat at the same spot when you walk or jog.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="font-size: 1.75em; color: #0f172a; margin-bottom: 14px;">When Should You See An Orthopaedic Doctor?</h2>
      <p>
        Do not wait for severe pain. You should consider a consultation if:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Pain in the foot or leg worsens with walking for more than five to seven days</li>
        <li>The pain is sharply localised to one point on the bone</li>
        <li>You find it painful to hop or stand on that leg alone</li>
        <li>There is swelling without any clear injury</li>
        <li>You are over forty and your bone density is already low</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A short visit can clarify whether this is a simple strain, a stress fracture or something else. Early clarity means a faster and safer recovery.

      <h2 style="font-size: 1.6em; color: #0f172a; margin-bottom: 14px;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3 style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 6px;">Can a stress fracture turn into a complete fracture?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. If you keep loading the bone heavily, a partial crack can progress to a complete break. This may then need a cast or even surgery. The aim of early diagnosis is to prevent this stage.
      </p>

      <h3 style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 6px;">Will I always need an MRI scan?</h3>
      <p>
        Not always. Many stress fractures can be managed based on clinical examination and follow up X rays. MRI is very useful in certain locations, such as the hip or navicular bone, or when pain is severe and early confirmation is essential.
      </p>

      <h3 style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 6px;">How long should I rest from walking or sport?</h3>
      <p>
        Most people need six to eight weeks of modified activity, with gradual progression planned by your doctor. The exact duration depends on which bone is affected, how severe the crack is and how strong your bone health is overall.
      </p>

      <h3 style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 6px;">Can I prevent stress fractures from coming back?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, recurrence risk falls significantly when you improve bone strength, correct vitamin D levels, use supportive footwear and increase activity levels gradually. Strength and balance exercises are central to prevention.
