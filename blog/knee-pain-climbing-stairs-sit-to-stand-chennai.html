      <h1>Knee Pain While Climbing Stairs and Getting Up From a Chair</h1>
      <p>
        If your knee pain is worse on stairs or when standing up from a chair, it often points to a load and movement control issue rather than serious joint damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explained clearly by <strong>Dr. Sumesh Subramanian</strong>, Orthopaedic Surgeon, OrthoCure Bone and Joint Speciality Clinic, Thirumullaivoyal.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Quick question:</strong> Does your pain sit mainly in the front of the knee, feel worse on stairs, but improve on flat walking?
        <br /><br />
        If yes, this guide is for you.
      </div>

      <p>
        Knee pain on stairs or while getting up from a chair is one of the most common problems I see in daily practice at OrthoCure, especially among patients from Thirumullaivoyal, Ambattur, and Avadi.
      </p>

      <p>
        The two biggest fears patients express are simple:
        <br />
        “Is this arthritis?” and “Will I need surgery?”
      </p>

      <p>
        In many cases, the answer to both is <strong>no</strong>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Why does knee pain worsen on stairs and chair rise?</h2>

      <p>
        When the knee bends under load, the kneecap presses firmly against the thigh bone. Movements like stair climbing, squatting, and standing up from a chair significantly increase this pressure.
      </p>

      <p>
        If hip and thigh muscles are not supporting the movement efficiently, extra stress concentrates at the front of the knee. This pain pattern is commonly called <strong>patellofemoral pain</strong>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Stairs require body weight support in a bent-knee position.</li>
        <li>Low chairs and sofas increase joint stress during standing up.</li>
        <li>Floor-level sitting and Indian toilets add further strain.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Is this always arthritis?</h2>

      <p>
        No. Many patients with front knee pain have normal X-rays. Arthritis is more likely when pain is associated with stiffness, swelling, or discomfort even during flat walking.
      </p>

      <p>
        A focused clinical examination usually clarifies the pattern quickly, without rushing into unnecessary scans.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>What actually helps?</h2>

      <p>
        Most patients improve with a structured, non-surgical plan that includes:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Education about load management.</li>
        <li>Strengthening of hip and thigh muscles.</li>
        <li>Gradual return to stairs with better control.</li>
        <li>Short-term pain relief only as support, not as the main solution.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Surgery is rarely required for this pain pattern.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>When should you see an orthopaedic doctor?</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>If pain persists beyond two to three weeks.</li>
        <li>If swelling, locking, or repeated giving way occurs.</li>
        <li>If pain worsens despite sensible activity modification.</li>
        <li>If you want clarity instead of repeated trial-and-error.</li>
      </ul>

        At OrthoCure Bone and Joint Speciality Clinic, Thirumullaivoyal, we focus on conservative care first and imaging only when it truly changes the plan.
