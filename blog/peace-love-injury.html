    <h1>Why PEACE & LOVE Is Replacing RICE for Injury Recovery</h1>

    <p>For decades, RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) was the standard advice for treating injuries like sprains, muscle strains, and ligament tears. But modern research shows that while RICE can relieve symptoms, it may not actually promote optimal recovery.</p>

    <h2>Why RICE Is No Longer Recommended</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ice reduces inflammation but can slow down the healing process.</li>
      <li>Excessive rest can lead to joint stiffness and muscle weakening.</li>
      <li>Anti-inflammatory medications may interfere with tissue regeneration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>RICE was created for symptom management—not healing.</em></p>

    <h2>Introducing the PEACE & LOVE Protocol</h2>

    <h3>PEACE (for immediate injury care)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Protect:</strong> Avoid painful movements and activities for the first few days.</li>
      <li><strong>Elevate:</strong> Raise the injured area above the level of the heart to reduce swelling.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Anti-Inflammatories:</strong> They may impair tissue healing during the early phase.</li>
      <li><strong>Compress:</strong> Use a bandage or taping to limit swelling and provide support.</li>
      <li><strong>Educate:</strong> Patients should be informed about the value of active recovery and proper load management.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>LOVE (for long-term healing)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Load:</strong> Introduce movement and resistance gradually to stimulate recovery.</li>
      <li><strong>Optimism:</strong> A positive mindset plays a key role in healing outcomes.</li>
      <li><strong>Vascularisation:</strong> Light cardio activity promotes circulation and healing.</li>
      <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Rehabilitation exercises restore mobility, strength, and coordination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When to Use PEACE & LOVE</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sports injuries</li>
      <li>Joint sprains</li>
      <li>Ligament strains</li>
      <li>Overuse injuries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What to Do If You’re Injured</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid prolonged rest or icing.</li>
      <li>Do not self-medicate with painkillers unless advised.</li>
      <li>Get assessed by a qualified orthopaedic expert early.</li>
      <li>Begin guided physiotherapy and recovery immediately.</li>
    </ul>
