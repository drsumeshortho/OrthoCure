      <p>For decades, RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) has been the go-to method for managing soft tissue injuries. However, updated guidelines published by Dubois and Esculier in the <em>British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020)</em> suggest a more holistic, evidence-based approach: PEACE & LOVE.</p>

        <h2>🚫 Why RICE Is Now Considered Outdated</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ice:</strong> May reduce pain, but can impair local circulation and delay healing.</li>
          <li><strong>Rest:</strong> Prolonged immobility leads to joint stiffness and muscle atrophy.</li>
          <li><strong>Anti-inflammatories:</strong> Suppress the body’s natural healing cascade.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Modern recovery focuses on active participation and cellular healing — not just symptom suppression.</em></p>

        <h3>🕊 PEACE (Immediate Care)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>P – Protect:</strong> Minimize movement and avoid pain triggers in the first 1–3 days.</li>
          <li><strong>E – Elevate:</strong> Elevate injured limb above heart level to reduce edema.</li>
          <li><strong>A – Avoid Anti-inflammatories:</strong> NSAIDs may interfere with tissue repair.</li>
          <li><strong>C – Compress:</strong> Use elastic bandages or sleeves to support and reduce swelling.</li>
          <li><strong>E – Educate:</strong> Patients should understand their injury, recovery process, and realistic timelines.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>❤️ LOVE (Subacute to Chronic Phase)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>L – Load:</strong> Initiate gradual loading and movement early to promote tissue remodeling.</li>
          <li><strong>O – Optimism:</strong> Patient mindset plays a measurable role in pain and outcome.</li>
          <li><strong>V – Vascularisation:</strong> Introduce pain-free aerobic activities like walking, cycling.</li>
          <li><strong>E – Exercise:</strong> Targeted rehab plans restore strength, balance, and function.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>📌 Common Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq">
        <strong>Does PEACE & LOVE apply to fractures?</strong>
        <p>No — it’s designed for soft tissue injuries. Fractures need immobilization, realignment, or surgery.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq">
        <strong>How soon can I begin rehab?</strong>
        <p>As early as 48–72 hours post-injury, under supervision. Early loading improves long-term results.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq">
        <strong>Can children follow this protocol?</strong>
        <p>Yes, with modified supervision. It encourages safe movement without medication overuse.</p>
