        <p class="highlight-box">
          Shoulder pain that wakes you up at night and slowly steals movement is frightening. Many patients worry about surgery. The reassuring truth is that most frozen shoulders improve without surgery when managed patiently and correctly.
        </p>

        <h2>What exactly is frozen shoulder</h2>
        <p>
          Frozen shoulder occurs when the capsule surrounding the shoulder joint becomes inflamed, thick and tight. This restricts movement in more than one direction and causes deep aching pain.
        </p>

        <h2>Why night pain and sleep loss are so common</h2>
        <p>
          Night pain is a hallmark feature. When the arm stays still for long periods, inflammation becomes more noticeable and pressure increases while lying down.
        </p>

        <h2>Who is at higher risk and why diabetes matters</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Age between 40 and 65 years</li>
          <li>Diabetes mellitus</li>
          <li>Thyroid disorders</li>
          <li>Prolonged immobilisation</li>
          <li>Previous frozen shoulder</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The stages and a realistic timeline</h2>
        <p>
          Frozen shoulder progresses through freezing, frozen and thawing stages. Sleep often improves first, then pain, then movement.
        </p>

        <h2>Treatment without rushing to surgery</h2>
        <p>
          Treatment focuses on pain control, guided physiotherapy, and gradual return of movement. In selected cases, injections may help reduce inflammation.
        </p>

        <h2>When surgery is considered</h2>
        <p>
          Surgery is rarely required and only considered after months of proper conservative care when stiffness remains severe.
