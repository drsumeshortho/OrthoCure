  <h1>Frozen Shoulder (Adhesive Capsulitis) Treatment in Chennai</h1>

  <p>Start Healing. Stay Moving.</p>

  <p>By Dr. Sumesh Subramanian | Orthopaedic Surgeon, Thirumullaivoyal, Chennai</p>

  <p>
    Frozen Shoulder, also called Adhesive Capsulitis, is one of the most common reasons for deep,
    nagging shoulder pain and stiffness in people between forty and seventy years. It affects about
    two to five percent of adults. In people with diabetes, the chance is much higher.
  </p>

  <p>
    At OrthoCure Thirumullaivoyal, I often see patients who have been told to just live with it.
    That is not the full story. With the right information, pain control, and a staged exercise plan,
    most people can get back to daily life with much better comfort and movement.

  <h2 id="what-is-frozen-shoulder">What is Frozen Shoulder</h2>

  <p>
    The shoulder joint is like a ball and socket wrapped in a loose sleeve called the capsule.
    In Frozen Shoulder this capsule becomes inflamed, thick, and tight. The inside space shrinks,
    and sticky bands form. The joint simply cannot glide the way it should.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/frozen-shoulder-normal-vs-capsule-tightening-orthocure.jpg"
         alt="Normal shoulder joint compared with tight, thickened capsule in Frozen Shoulder"
         loading="lazy">
    <figcaption>
      Normal shoulder on the left. In Frozen Shoulder the capsule becomes thick, inflamed, and tight,
      which limits movement in all directions.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Pain and stiffness are out of proportion to any visible X ray changes. This is why many patients
    are confused when their reports look almost normal yet everyday tasks are difficult.
  </p>

  <h2 id="who-gets-frozen-shoulder">Who gets Frozen Shoulder</h2>

  <p>
    Any adult can develop Frozen Shoulder, but some people are clearly at higher risk.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Age between forty and seventy years.</li>
    <li>Diabetes, especially if long standing or poorly controlled.</li>
    <li>Thyroid disease, both underactive and overactive states.</li>
    <li>Recent shoulder injury, fracture, or surgery with prolonged immobilisation.</li>
    <li>Prolonged bed rest or arm support after heart or chest procedures.</li>
    <li>Other metabolic conditions or autoimmune disease.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In my practice in Thirumullaivoyal, many cases come from Ambattur, Avadi, and nearby areas where
    diabetes is common and work often involves desk jobs with limited shoulder movement.
  </p>

  <figure>

         alt="Middle aged person with diabetes holding a painful stiff shoulder"
         loading="lazy">
    <figcaption>
      Diabetes and thyroid disease increase the risk of Frozen Shoulder and often prolong the course.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    If your symptoms are more widespread, involve many joints, or come with swelling and morning
    stiffness in the hands, also see our article
    <a href="/blog/early-arthritis-signs.html">Do I Have Early Arthritis</a> for a broader view
    of inflammatory joint problems.
  </p>

  <h2 id="symptoms-stages">Symptoms and the three stages of Frozen Shoulder</h2>

  <p>
    The classic features are deep shoulder pain, difficulty lying on that side, and stiff movement
    in almost every direction. Wearing a blouse or shirt, combing hair, reaching into the back seat
    of a car, or putting on a bra become difficult.
  </p>

  <p>
    Frozen Shoulder usually progresses through three overlapping stages. These are not strict boxes
    but they help you understand what is happening.
  </p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Stage</th>
        <th>What you feel</th>
        <th>Typical duration</th>
        <th>Clinical notes</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Freezing stage</td>
        <td>Strong pain, especially at night and at the end of movement. Stiffness slowly increasing.</td>
        <td>Three to eight months</td>
        <td>Inflammation in the capsule is active. Aim is pain control and gentle protected movement.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Frozen stage</td>
        <td>Pain gradually reduces, stiffness is the main complaint. Range is markedly limited.</td>
        <td>Four to twelve months</td>
        <td>Capsule is thick and tight. Focus is on stretching, physiotherapy, and function.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Thawing stage</td>
        <td>Pain is much less. Movement slowly improves, first in daily tasks then in overhead reach.</td>
        <td>Six to eighteen months</td>
        <td>Gradual remodelling of capsule. Consistent exercises help regain strength and range.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

    <figcaption>
      Frozen Shoulder is a slow condition. Knowing the stages avoids unrealistic expectations and panic.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h2 id="diagnosis">How Frozen Shoulder is diagnosed</h2>

  <p>
    Diagnosis is mainly clinical. During an examination I look for a reduction in both active and
    passive movements in more than one direction, together with characteristic pain.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tests often used include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      X ray of the shoulder to rule out arthritis, fracture, or dislocation. In pure Frozen Shoulder
      this is usually normal.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ultrasound if we suspect a rotator cuff tear, bursitis, or significant calcium deposit.
    </li>
    <li>
      Blood tests in selected patients, especially when diabetes, thyroid disease, or inflammatory
      arthritis are suspected.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Frozen Shoulder is sometimes confused with rotator cuff problems or neck related pain.
    A structured assessment sorts this out. For wider joint issues and red flags, see our guide
    <a href="/blog/monsoon-joint-pain.html">Monsoon and Joint Pain in Chennai</a>, which covers
    warning signs that need earlier review.
  </p>

  <h2 id="treatment-without-surgery">Treatment without surgery</h2>

  <p>
    The good news is that many people improve with non surgical care, especially when treatment is
    started early and tailored to the stage of the condition and to diabetes status.
  </p>

  <h3>Pain control and rest that is sensible</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Short courses of pain relieving medicines and anti inflammatory drugs where safe, after
      checking other health conditions.
    </li>
    <li>
      A well fitted sling in the very painful phase for short periods, but not all day. Complete rest
      slows recovery.
    </li>
    <li>
      Night support with a pillow under the arm and attention to sleep, as outlined in our article
      <a href="/blog/sleep-and-joint-healing-orthocure-thirumullaivoyal.html">Why Your Joints Need Good Sleep to Heal</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Structured physiotherapy and home exercises</h3>

  <p>
    Once pain is reasonably controlled, guided stretching and gradual strengthening are the main
    treatment. Random movements or aggressive forcing can flare the capsule and set you back.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/frozen-shoulder-exercises-wallcrawl-pendulum-orthocure.jpg"
         alt="Gentle wall crawl and pendulum exercises for Frozen Shoulder under guidance"
         loading="lazy">
    <figcaption>
      Simple exercises like pendulum swings and wall crawl movements, done correctly, help the
      shoulder regain movement over time.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <ul>
    <li>Pendulum swings with the trunk supported.</li>
    <li>Wall crawl in forward and side directions.</li>
    <li>Passive external rotation stretches using a stick.</li>
    <li>Later, isometric and then resisted strengthening for rotator cuff and scapular muscles.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The plan is always adjusted for pain, stage, and diabetes control. For many working adults in
    Ambattur and Avadi, we build a routine that fits into early morning or late evening schedules.
  </p>

  <h3>Injections and other procedures</h3>

  <p>
    In selected cases, a steroid injection into the joint under guidance can reduce capsule
    inflammation and cut pain, especially in the freezing stage. This makes physiotherapy easier
    to start. In some cases, a distension procedure with fluid is considered to stretch the capsule.
  </p>

  <p>
    Injections are not a shortcut and they are not repeated casually. They are most useful as one
    part of a larger plan that includes movement, strength work, and good blood sugar control.
    The same principle applies for other joint conditions where injections are used, such as knee
    arthritis. You can read more about this approach in our article
    <a href="/blog/walkingwitharthritis.html">Is Walking Harmful for Knee Arthritis? Myth Busted, Benefits and Safe Tips</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="when-surgery">When is surgery considered</h2>

  <p>
    Surgery is not the first line in Frozen Shoulder. It is considered only when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stiffness remains severe after many months of well supervised physiotherapy.</li>
    <li>Pain and limit in movement clearly affect work and self care.</li>
    <li>Other causes like rotator cuff tear have been evaluated and addressed.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Options include manipulation under anaesthesia or arthroscopic capsular release. Both need
    close post procedure physiotherapy. The decision is very individual and depends on age,
    diabetes control, work demands, and response to earlier treatment.
  </p>

  <p>
    In many patients who come to OrthoCure Thirumullaivoyal, clear education and a realistic
    timeline, combined with a consistent exercise program, help avoid surgery altogether.
  </p>

  <h2 id="living-with-frozen-shoulder">Living with Frozen Shoulder in Chennai</h2>

  <p>
    While the condition runs its natural course, simple daily adjustments reduce strain and keep you
    as independent as possible.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Use the other arm for heavy lifting, but do not completely neglect the affected side.</li>
    <li>Adjust work and kitchen shelves so that frequently used items are between chest and waist height.</li>
    <li>Avoid sudden jerks, heavy overhead loads, and long periods with the arm hanging unsupported.</li>
    <li>Use public transport or bike handles with care; avoid sudden pulls and pushes in traffic.</li>
    <li>Plan short, frequent exercise breaks rather than one long session.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Principles of sensible loading and graded activity are similar to the PEACE and LOVE strategy
    for injuries explained in our article
    <a href="/blog/peace-love-injury.html">Why PEACE and LOVE is Replacing RICE in Injury Recovery</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="when-to-see-doctor">When to see your orthopaedic doctor</h2>

  <p>
    See a specialist without delay if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pain has lasted more than four to six weeks and is not improving.</li>
    <li>Night pain wakes you from sleep often.</li>
    <li>You cannot lift the arm to shoulder level or reach behind your back.</li>
    <li>You have diabetes or thyroid disease and shoulder pain that is not explained.</li>
    <li>There is sudden loss of power, recent fall, or obvious deformity.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    An early, accurate diagnosis avoids months of trial and error and helps you understand what to
    expect at each stage. At OrthoCure Bone and Joint Speciality Clinic, Thirumullaivoyal, we focus
    on practical plans that fit your daily life in Chennai, not just textbook protocols.
  </p>

  <h2 id="faq">Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <h3>Can Frozen Shoulder affect both sides</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. Most people start with one shoulder, but the other side can be affected later, especially
    in diabetes. This is another reason to keep blood sugar controlled and shoulder joints moving.
  </p>

  <h3>Will my shoulder become completely normal again</h3>
  <p>
    Many patients regain near normal use for daily activities. Some may have mild loss at the end
    of range, such as extreme reach, but this rarely limits normal life if the program is followed
    well. The key is patience and consistency through the stages.
  </p>

  <h3>Is Frozen Shoulder permanent damage</h3>
  <p>
    In true Adhesive Capsulitis, changes are largely soft tissue based and can remodel over time.
    This is different from advanced arthritis where cartilage is worn out. Pathway and prognosis
    are different.
  </p>

  <h3>What if I cannot do physiotherapy regularly</h3>
  <p>
    Even if formal sessions are limited, a clearly explained home program with periodic review can
    help. In our clinic we often train patients and family members together so that support at home
    is practical.
  </p>
