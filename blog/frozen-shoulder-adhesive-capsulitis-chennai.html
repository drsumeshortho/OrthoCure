      <!-- Intro -->
      <section class="blog-section">
        <h2>What Is Frozen Shoulder?</h2>
        <p>
          Frozen shoulder, also called <strong>adhesive capsulitis</strong>, is a condition where the soft tissue capsule around your shoulder joint becomes inflamed, thickened, and tight. 
          This leads to a combination of <strong>pain</strong> and <strong>progressive stiffness</strong>, especially for overhead activities and twisting movements like combing hair, wearing blouse hooks, or reaching the back pocket.
        </p>
        <p>
          The condition is most common in people between 40 and 65 years and is frequently seen in those with <strong>diabetes, thyroid disorders, or prolonged shoulder immobility</strong>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Symptoms -->
      <section class="blog-section">
        <h2>Common Symptoms of Frozen Shoulder</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Gradually increasing shoulder pain without a major fall or injury.</li>
          <li>Pain is often worse at night and can disturb sleep.</li>
          <li>Difficulty lifting the arm up, out to the side, or rotating it behind the back.</li>
          <li>Stiffness in all directions, not just for one or two movements.</li>
          <li>Simple activities like wearing a saree blouse, taking wallet from back pocket, or washing hair become difficult.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Many patients from <strong>Thirumullaivoyal, Ambattur, Avadi, Annanur, and Iyyapakkam</strong> initially think this is a simple muscle pull and wait for months. 
          Early diagnosis makes treatment smoother and often reduces the overall duration of the condition.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Stages -->
      <section class="blog-section">
        <h2>Stages of Frozen Shoulder</h2>
        <p>Frozen shoulder typically passes through three overlapping stages:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Freezing stage (Painful stage)</strong>  
            Pain is the main complaint. Stiffness begins gradually. Night pain is common. This phase may last from 2 to 9 months.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Frozen stage (Stiff stage)</strong>  
            Pain slowly reduces but stiffness becomes more pronounced. Range of motion is markedly restricted. This stage may last 4 to 12 months.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Thawing stage (Recovery stage)</strong>  
            Gradual improvement in movement. Pain continues to reduce. Recovery can take several months.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The total course can range from 1 to 3 years. The good news: with <strong>proper physiotherapy, targeted injections, and medical guidance</strong>, many patients can speed up recovery and regain useful function much earlier.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Causes and Risk Factors -->
      <section class="blog-section">
        <h2>Who Is at Risk for Frozen Shoulder?</h2>
        <p>Important risk factors include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Diabetes</strong> (type 1 or type 2) – frozen shoulder is significantly more common and often more stubborn.</li>
          <li><strong>Thyroid disease</strong> – both hypo and hyper thyroid conditions are linked.</li>
          <li><strong>Prolonged immobilisation</strong> – after fractures, rotator cuff tears, or surgery when the shoulder is kept in a sling for long.</li>
          <li><strong>Previous shoulder injury or surgery</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Other metabolic factors</strong> such as high cholesterol or features of metabolic syndrome in some patients.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you are diabetic in the Ambattur or Avadi region and suddenly find one shoulder becoming painful and stiff, especially at night, it is wise to get evaluated early at a dedicated bone and joint clinic.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Diagnosis -->
      <section class="blog-section">
        <h2>How Is Frozen Shoulder Diagnosed?</h2>
        <p>
          Frozen shoulder is primarily a <strong>clinical diagnosis</strong>. A trained orthopaedic surgeon will:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Take a detailed history of onset, pain pattern, and daily limitations.</li>
          <li>Examine shoulder movements actively (your effort) and passively (doctor moving your shoulder).</li>
          <li>Note global restriction in movement, particularly in rotation.</li>
          <li>Check for other causes like rotator cuff tears, arthritis, cervical spine issues, or nerve related problems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Simple <strong>X ray</strong> of the shoulder is usually done to rule out arthritis or other bone problems. 
          Ultrasound or MRI is used selectively if there is suspicion of associated rotator cuff tear or other pathology.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Treatment Overview -->
      <section class="blog-section">
        <h2>Treatment: Is Surgery Always Required for Frozen Shoulder?</h2>
        <p>
          In most patients, <strong>surgery is not the first line</strong>. The primary goals are to control pain, reduce inflammation, and gradually restore movement.
        </p>
        <h3>1. Pain Control and Inflammation Reduction</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Short course of pain medicines and anti inflammatory drugs as appropriate.</li>
          <li>Ice packs in the early painful stage for short periods, especially after exercises.</li>
          <li>Topical gels or patches for local pain relief.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Physiotherapy and Exercise</h3>
        <p>
          Regular, guided exercises are the <strong>core of treatment</strong>. Key components include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gentle pendulum swings.</li>
          <li>Assisted forward elevation using the other hand or a stick.</li>
          <li>Wall climbing exercises for elevation.</li>
          <li>External rotation stretches with a stick or towel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Exercises should be done within tolerable limits, usually several times a day, and progressed gradually. 
          Over aggressive, painful stretching can worsen symptoms, especially in diabetics.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Injection Therapies</h3>
        <p>
          In selected cases, a <strong>corticosteroid injection</strong> into the shoulder joint can reduce inflammation and pain, especially in the early “freezing” stage, allowing better participation in physiotherapy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Newer options like <strong>hydrodilatation</strong> (distension of the joint capsule with fluid) or <strong>platelet rich plasma (PRP)</strong> injections are sometimes used based on individual case assessment and current evidence.
        </p>

        <h3>4. When Is Surgery Considered?</h3>
        <p>
          If, despite months of well supervised therapy and injections, the shoulder remains severely stiff and painful, options such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Manipulation under anaesthesia</strong> or</li>
          <li><strong>Arthroscopic capsular release</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          may be discussed. These are reserved for selected patients and are always followed by intensive physiotherapy to maintain the gained movement.
        </p>

      <!-- FAQ -->
      <section class="blog-section">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions on Frozen Shoulder</h2>

        <h3>1. How long does frozen shoulder last?</h3>
        <p>
          Without any treatment, frozen shoulder can last 1 to 3 years. With early diagnosis, proper medicines, and regular exercises under guidance, many patients improve much sooner and regain function well before this.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Is frozen shoulder permanently curable?</h3>
        <p>
          Most people recover functional movement sufficient for daily life. Some may have minor stiffness at extreme ranges. Good diabetes and thyroid control, plus adherence to exercises, greatly improves long term outcomes.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Can frozen shoulder affect both shoulders?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. In a subset of patients, especially those with diabetes, the other shoulder can be affected, either at the same time or later. Early recognition and preventive exercises may help reduce severity.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Are there specific exercises I can do at home?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Pendulum swings, wall slides, stick assisted movements, and gentle rotation exercises are commonly prescribed. However, the exact protocol should be customised based on your stage and pain level, ideally after examination by an orthopaedic specialist or physiotherapist.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Will I definitely need surgery?</h3>
        <p>
          No. A large proportion of frozen shoulder patients respond well to non surgical treatment. Surgery is reserved for the few who remain significantly stiff and painful despite a structured, well followed plan.
