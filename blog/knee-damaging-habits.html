      <p>Knees are like car tyres‚Äîyou don‚Äôt notice the damage until one day they stop working smoothly. Even if you're not in pain today, your daily habits might be silently wearing them down. As an orthopaedic surgeon, I see these five knee-damaging habits all the time. Scientific literature has long supported the role of modifiable lifestyle factors in joint degeneration and early-onset osteoarthritis [1][2].</p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Sitting Cross-Legged for Long Hours</h2>
      <p>Prolonged cross-legged sitting, especially on the floor, increases pressure on the patellofemoral joint and can lead to anterior knee pain and cartilage stress, particularly in those predisposed to patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) [3].</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Skipping Warm-Ups Before Exercise</h2>
      <p>Initiating exercise without a warm-up increases the risk of musculoskeletal injury. Warming up improves blood flow and joint lubrication, reducing joint stiffness and risk of strain on the articular cartilage and ligaments [4][5].</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Wearing Poor Footwear</h2>
      <p>Improper footwear alters lower limb biomechanics, shifting abnormal stress to the knee joint. Studies show that poor arch support and worn soles contribute to medial compartment knee osteoarthritis over time [6].</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Using Stairs Excessively With Poor Form</h2>
      <p>Descending stairs places approximately 3‚Äì5 times bodyweight force on the knee joint. Poor form (forward leaning, rapid descent) amplifies this and is associated with patellar tendinopathy and progression of joint degeneration in older adults [7][8].</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Ignoring Early Signs</h2>
      <p>Symptoms like crepitus, mild swelling, stiffness, and instability are often early signs of cartilage degradation or meniscal damage. Ignoring these can delay diagnosis and allow degenerative processes to advance [9].</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Takeaway</h2>
      <p>You don't need to wait for knee pain to start protecting your joints. Simple changes in posture, footwear, exercise, and attention can make a huge difference. And if you‚Äôre already experiencing some of these signs, now‚Äôs the best time to act.</p>
