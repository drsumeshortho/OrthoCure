  <p>Joint pain in older adults isn't just a part of aging ‚Äî it‚Äôs often worsened by common, avoidable mistakes. At OrthoCure Bone & Joint Speciality Clinic, we see these patterns again and again. Let‚Äôs fix them.</p>

  <h2>Mistake #1: Resting too much after pain starts</h2>
  <p>While rest feels right, prolonged inactivity can actually stiffen joints and weaken muscles. Gentle, guided movement is essential for recovery ‚Äî not dangerous.</p>

  <h2>Mistake #2: Relying only on painkillers ‚Äî no physio, no plan</h2>
  <p>This is the silent killer of joint health. Pain relief tablets may mask the problem, but without structured physiotherapy, joints deteriorate further. Movement-based care is what protects long-term function.</p>

  <h2>Mistake #3: Thinking it's 'just age' ‚Äî and delaying expert care</h2>
  <p>Age is not a reason to suffer. Early orthopaedic and physiotherapy intervention can delay or even prevent surgery. The earlier we act, the better we preserve mobility and independence.</p>
