    <h1>3 Mistakes That Make Elderly Joint Pain Worse (And Nobody Talks About #2)</h1>

  <section>
    <p>Joint pain is not just a part of ageing — it's often a sign that your joints are crying out for help. Many elderly individuals unknowingly make small daily mistakes that worsen their symptoms. This article highlights three of the most common — and avoidable — ones.</p>

    <h2>Mistake #1: Ignoring Pain Until It Becomes Severe</h2>
    <p>Many elderly people think joint pain is 'normal with age'. But untreated pain leads to joint degeneration, muscle weakness, and reduced independence. Early physiotherapy and medical attention can dramatically slow the progression of arthritis. Don’t wait until walking becomes difficult.</p>

    <h2>Mistake #2: Using Painkillers Without Supervision</h2>
    <p>NSAIDs (like diclofenac, ibuprofen) are commonly used but can be harmful to elderly patients, especially those with kidney or heart conditions. These should only be used under supervision. Safer alternatives include topical creams, heat therapy, and guided physiotherapy.</p>

    <h2>Mistake #3: Avoiding Movement Out of Fear</h2>
    <p>Resting too much weakens joints. The right kind of movement – such as supervised physiotherapy, daily walks, and range-of-motion exercises – can reduce stiffness and improve strength. Immobilizing a painful joint can make it worse.</p>

    <h2>What You Should Do Instead</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start early physiotherapy:</strong> Builds strength, reduces stiffness.</li>
      <li><strong>Consider joint-friendly supplements:</strong> Calcium, Vitamin D3, and omega-3 may help. Always consult your doctor.</li>
      <li><strong>Intra-articular injections:</strong> Options like hyaluronic acid and PRP can provide relief for certain types of arthritis when done at the right stage. These are minimally invasive and avoid surgery when used appropriately <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6769334/" target="_blank">[Reference]</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Anti-inflammatory diet:</strong> Include turmeric, ginger, green leafy vegetables, nuts, and berries. Reduce sugar and processed foods.</li>
      <li><strong>Get regular checkups:</strong> Even mild pain deserves evaluation. It might reveal early signs of osteoarthritis or vitamin deficiency.</li>
    </ul>
